The code here allows to reproduce easily the fig 1, analyze your own
multi-electrode data, and generate surrogate data with the same
statistics than the ones captured by the Markov model. The approach is
the following:

-load or generate a raster
-compute the mean activity of each neuron (m), the instantaneous
 pairwise correlations (C), and the pairwise correlations between time
 t and time t+1.
-estimate the h, J and J1 parameters of the model corresponding to the
 m, C and C1: by an analytical approximation followed by a gradient
 descent. This might not be enough for a large number of neurons.
-Estimating the performance of the fit by comparing the prediction,
 and the empirical estimation, of the ocurrence rate of different
 spatio-temporal spiking patterns. This is done for different temporal
 sizes of these patterns.

The program "BatchOctestGlauber" is performing all these steps. 

1)How to use this program:

-The best is probably to first have a look on the code which
 reproduces the figure 1. First launch "i2mPath" to set all the
 sub-directories. Then "BatchOctestGlauber" will do all the analysis
 (it takes several minutes), and stores the results in the WorkSpace
 directory. Then launch "Fig1" to draw the figure.
-To analyze your data, construct a file "spikes.txt" which contain the
 spike times, with the format explained in /LoadRaster/LoadRaster.m
-the directory InfoTools contains some simple methods to measure the
 Kullback-Leibler (KL) and the Jensen Shannon (Djs) divergences.
-/Surrogate/Surrogate.m will generate some surrogate data having the
 same statistics than the ones captured by the model.


2) The code is organized in different directories:

-Common: The core of the program. Contains all the functions needed to
 fit the model to mean and correlations measured from the data.
-FigurePlot: routines to plot the Figure 1 of the paper
-Figures: directory where automatically generated figures will be
 stored.
-Glauber: to simulate the Glauber model
-InfoTools: contains some simple methods to measure the
 Kullback-Leibler (KL) and the Jensen Shannon (Djs) divergences.
-LoadRaster: to load and bin a raster
-surrogate: Surrogate.m will generate some surrogate data having the
 same statistics than the ones captured by the model.
-Workspace: where the workspace is stored after running one of the
 batchs.
